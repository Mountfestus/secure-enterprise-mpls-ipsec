# Secure IPSec-over-MPLS Enterprise Branch Connectivity

This project is based on my MSc research in Computer Networks and Security at the University of Staffordshire. It demonstrates a secure and resilient enterprise network architecture that connects a remote branch office to a headquarters site using **MPLS Layer 3 VPN**, overlaid with **IPSec encryption** to protect data across an ISP core network.

## üß† Objectives

- Deploy an IPSec tunnel across an MPLS Layer 3 VPN architecture
- Simulate a real-world ISP CE/PE design with Cisco routers and Juniper SRX firewalls
- Implement dynamic routing using OSPF and MP-BGP
- Demonstrate how VRFs and GRE tunnels can be used for path isolation
- Validate connectivity scenarios with test outputs

## üîß Topology Overview

The lab simulates an enterprise head office and a remote branch, connected via an ISP MPLS network. IPSec tunnels provide secure encrypted communication between the two sites.
